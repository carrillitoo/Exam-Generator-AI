Knight's Tour (8x8 board)\n\nWhich is the most suitable solving strategy for the N-Queens problem with N=8 from those presented in the course (BFS, DFS, A*, Hill Climbing, Backtracking)?",
    "expected_answer": {
      "strategy": "Backtracking",
      "explanation": "N-Queens is a constraint satisfaction problem where we need to find valid placements. Backtracking is ideal because it explores the search space systematically, prunes invalid branches early, and guarantees finding a solution if one exists. DFS could work but lacks the constraint-checking optimization. BFS and A* are inefficient for this combinatorial problem.",
